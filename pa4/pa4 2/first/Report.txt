For the cache simulator I had a tough time as I was sick and also had a big hockey tourtament, but obviously no excuses. 
However, I'd still like to share my opinion as to how I would have liked to create it.My intentions for the simulator 
was to  create a 2-D matrix. What I tried doing is to make sure the number of sets isthe amount of rows there are. While the 
columns would correlate with the associativity which would've been the number of blocks in a set. The for each elememnt in the 
array three variables of information would be stored. They are tag, set, and counter. Counter would be helpful for LRU since 
there would be a counter to see which one is the least used it wouldcount how many times the information the piece of data would 
be used, to know which would be kicked out. All you have to dois compare the amount of times used and see which is the least.

I also would have implemented FIFO, it would've been easy because the first of every row would be first to be implemeted and then be 
filled. The information for the amount of times used would always go back to the beginning of the row and kick the element, 
since it's the first one to be put in a matrix.

For prefetching it would allow for there to  be more hits, but the number of writes would actually be the same. Because every time 
you read into memory and see that if it's a mtrix you need to write that element and the one after. Increasing the amount of hits 
since read faster and hits are being filled faster. Essentially gettimng more information with each element, because it would need 
to write anyways; however, it's now being written earlier meaning 
it can cause more hits. 


This is how I would've liked to deseign my simulator, I understand I will have many  points taken  away, but if some gradtitude 
can be given from this it would be greatly apprecitaed. 

Thank you for a great semester!
